# Cache Folder

The `cache` folder is used to store cache files
that are automatically generated by MATLAB and Simulink.

## Code generation cache folder

The `codegen` folder is used to store files that
are automatically generated by code generation features.

## Simulation cache file folder

The `simcache` folder is used to store `.slxc` simulation cache files.
Cache files are generated and maintained by Simulink
for faster simulation.
For details, see the documentation
[Share Simulink Cache Files for Faster Simulation][url1].

By default, simulation cache files are stored in the working folder.
You can customize the cache file folder in MATLAB project.
To change the folder, navigate from the Toolstrip,
PROJECT tab > ENVIRONMENT group > Details window > Simulation cache folder.
